## Purpose
- Mobile-first is the core focus of Instatrim.  
- Delivers full video editing + AI features on handheld devices.  
- Designed for offline-first usage with cloud sync as an option.  
- Prioritizes speed, simplicity, and creator-friendly UI.  

## Tech Stack (planned)
- Kotlin (Android)  
- Swift (iOS)  
- Flutter/Dart (optional shared modules for hybrid logic)  
- Native libraries:  
  - Camera APIs  
  - FFmpeg for video editing  
  - TensorFlow Lite / Core ML for AI features  
- Firebase/Supabase backend sync (auth, storage, analytics)  

## Roadmap
1. Android scaffolding setup (Kotlin)  
2. iOS scaffolding setup (Swift)  
3. Shared logic modules (Flutter/Native bridge if required)  
4. Camera + Editor core  
5. AI Feature integrations  

## Status
- Initial placeholder only.  
- Full implementation will be added in later phases.

- Run on an emulator or physical device.  

### 2. iOS (Swift)
- Open the `ios/` folder in Xcode.  
- Run on a simulator or physical device.  

### 3. Shared Modules (future)
